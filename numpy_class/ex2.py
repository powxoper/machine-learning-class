    Demonstrate the central limit theorem (CLT)
    Recall:
    If Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + ... + XN
    where X are IID (independent, identically distributed)
    Then as N -> infinity, Y -> Gaussian distribution
    Use the uniform distribution as your base for X
    Use N = 1000 (or higher if you want)
    Then draw 1000 Y's (or more if you want)
    Plot histogram of Y's -> should be a "bell curve"
    Bonus: find the expected mean and variance of Y
